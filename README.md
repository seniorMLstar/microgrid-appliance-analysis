## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
```
yarn dev    // Runs the app in the development mode at http://localhost:3000

yarn test     // Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

yarn build    // Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

yarn eject    // Unpack create-react-app presets. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!

```

## Deploy
```
yarn build
git push heroku master  // Deploy master branch to production heroku instance (need to be logged in and have authorization)

```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

## App Design

- Generally using domain-driven development (DDD)
- Define all fields with JSON schema (type, default value, min, max, prefix, suffix)
- Define a component that incorporates all of these properties. It’s got a default, overridable value and it’s got a slider if a number, with min and max. Pass the component the field from the schema def and the store? Not sure how it would work with apollo link-state and graphql
- Define typescript types based on this JSON schema for all fields: https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/03/26/typescript-data-validation/
- Generate TS types from graphql queries: https://blog.apollographql.com/graphql-dx-d35bcf51c943
- JSON Schema validator: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv

## Notes

Welder and Water pump throughput:

> I think what we need to do is let the tool apply some value to a unit of welding (maybe hours), and a value to a unit of water (liters) , but then it’ll be up to the user to decide what to put in there for water pumping in particular, one kind of pump (submersible) could be used to pump drinking water to be sold, which is a very standard economic model, but another kind of pump (surface) could be used to water small horticultural crops for which a person wouldn’t realize the economic value for several months until the harvest happens.
